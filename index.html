          Hi, my name is Lyla! I'm a graphic designer from New York, NY. I like
          to work on lots of different projects, from logo design, to web and
          UI/UX development.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've been working as a designer for more than 10 years, and have
          experience working with a variety of different clients and projects.
