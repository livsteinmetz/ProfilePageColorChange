# ProfilePageColorChange

Hi! Thanks so much for helping me out on this project.

I have this website that a friend built for me a while back,
and I really want to update the colors on the site to make it less dark.

I put some screenshots in this folder that show what I want the site
to look like when you're done, so hopefully that should help.

![Finished Request](https://github.com/HelloTidBytes/ProfilePageColorChange/blob/master/request_desktop.png?raw=true)

Here are the colors I'd like to use:

Background:

- Can you make a gradient from the top left corner to the bottom right?
- The gradient should go from #ADD8E6 to #4169e1.

Headers:

- Can you make the two headers "Lyla Carver" and "Graphic Designer" yellow?
- The hex value I'd like to use is #FDFD96.

Buttons:

- Can you make the buttons navy with white text?
- The navy color should be #1A2B54;

Also, could you add one extra border that's a link to my twitter page?

- The button should just go right next to the email button.
- The button should say "Follow Lyla on Twitter"
- It should link to https://twitter.com/lylas-fake-twitter-handle
- It should open the twitter page in a new tab
